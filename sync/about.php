						<h2>About</h2><br/>
						<img src="/src/bio.jpg" class="infoimg"><br/>
							My name is Noah KÃ¶nig (* 2001) and besides studying computer science at LMU Munich I'm highly interested in everything storytelling.<br/><br/>
							At the age of 13 a school project inspired my passion for filmmaking. For years, I have been looking for new experiences concerning the topic of movies: cinematography, visual effects, editing... the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>
							Together with Nicolas Winter I run <i> <a class="textarealink" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC04w0nc44q17T2eZ-1LNk0A/featured" target="_blank"> Another World Films </a> </i> on YouTube where our long-term movie project <i> Death in Time </i> - a german fan episode of the BBC series <i> Doctor Who </i> - was released in April 2021.<br/><br/>
							After the release of our feature film, we decided to move to game developing. Planned to be released on PC, an original IP is currently in the making.<br/><br/>
							When I'm not busy working on our video game or doing University stuff, I waste my time with video games and modding them, playing guitar and violin, riding my bike or doing web design.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
